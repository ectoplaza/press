## Description

EctoPlaza is a competitive smash 'em up where you fling, dodge, and ground pound through haunted halls and ghostly friends to achieve victory. EctoPlaza's everlasting guests have developed a bad case of cabin fever, rocketing off the walls, into each other, and through priceless furniture. Mastering multi-tiered charge fling systems and unique character abilities is the key to sending friends and their ghosts flying. Be our ghastly guests and have the time of your afterlife!

### History

EctoPlaza was originally pitched and accepted into the 2015 Dare to be Digital game-making competition held by Abertay University. Drawing crowds of all ages, EctoPlaza won ProtoPlay's Audience Choice Award and was subsequently picked as an "Official Select" for IndieCade 2016. Slated for release on the Wii U 2016, EctoPlaza will be the debut game for Syndicate Atomic.
